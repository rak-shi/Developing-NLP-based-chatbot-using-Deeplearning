# Developing-NLP-based-chatbot-using-Deeplearning
In this i have developed retrieval based chatbot system using nlp and deeplearning.
As I was developed a retrieval-based chatbot, we should define responses as “Intents” in a JSON file to effectively answer questions, search from a knowledge base, and engage in conversations with users, a chatbot needs the ability to understand and interpret user input, determining their intentions and meaning. This understanding is crucial for the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant responses.
