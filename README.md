# Developing-NLP-based-chatbot-using-Deeplearning
In this i have developed retrieval based chatbot system using nlp and deeplearning.
As I was developed a retrieval-based chatbot, we should define responses as “Intents” in a JSON file to effectively answer questions, search from a knowledge base, and engage in conversations with users, a chatbot needs the ability to understand and interpret user input, determining their intentions and meaning. This understanding is crucial for the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant responses.


The intents I have given:

Packages:
nltk==3.7
numpy==1.23.3
tensorflow==2.10.0
joblib==1.2.0
keras==2.10.0
Keras-Preprocessing==1.1.2

This framework provides a structured approach to designing, developing, and deploying chatbot solutions. It outlines the key components and considerations involved in creating an effective and functional chatbot. The database represents the intents of the chatbot.
